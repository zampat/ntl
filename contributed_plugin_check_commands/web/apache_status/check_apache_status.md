- open slots
- busy workers
- idle workers
- requests per second

- bytes per request

## Threshold and ranges

A threshold is a [range](https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#THRESHOLDFORMAT) with an alert level (either WARNING or CRITICAL).
Thresholds will be set comma separated in the following order:

- open slots
- busy workers
- idle workers
- requests per second
- bytes per second
- bytes per request

A range is defined as a start and end point (inclusive) on a numeric scale (possibly negative or positive infinity).

This is the generalised format for ranges:

```[@]start:end```

### Notes

- start â‰¤ end
- start and ":" is not required if start=0
- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified, assume end is infinity
- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range (inclusive of endpoints)
- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range (inclusive of endpoints)

### Examples


Setting non for one of them is also possible. The following example sets the threshold for _busy workers_ to WARNING for at least 10 _busy workers_ and CRITICAL to at least of 25 _busy workers_:

```check_apache_status.pl -H localhost -w ,10,,,, -c ,25,,,,```

To additionally set the threshold for _open_slots_ to WARNING when at or below 10 and CRITICAL when at or below 5:

```check_apache_status.pl -H localhost -w 10:,10,,,, -c 5:,25,,,,```
