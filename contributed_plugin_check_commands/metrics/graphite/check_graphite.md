A monitoring plugin for Icinga (2), Nagios, Shinken, Naemon, etc. to check the Logstash API (Logstash v.5+)

While the plugin works with the first release of Logstash 5.0, there is still some work to be done and some tests to be made.

A word of warning Be sure to read the configuration check part of this readme since there is a problem with this feature.
