This script is a Nagios/Monitoring plugin to monitor the hardware of ESX and ESXi servers. It queries the CIM (Common Information Model) server running on the ESXi server to retrieve the current status of all discovered hardware parts. The plugin can also be used as standalone script to check the hardware - Nagios or Icinga isn't necessary to run it. The plugin is written in python and uses the pywbem module. See Requirements for more information.
