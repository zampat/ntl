Interfacetable_v3t (formerly check_interface_table_v3t) is a Nagios(R) addon that allows you to monitor the network interfaces of a node (e.g. router, switch, server) without knowing each interface in detail. Only the hostname (or ip address) and the snmp community string are required. It generates a html page gathering some info on the monitored node and a table of all interfaces/ports and their status.
